The <code>OnProcessTerminate</code> method, which is implemented in the game server code, must include a call to the server SDK action <code>ProcessEnding()</code>, which is how the server process signals to Amazon GameLift Servers that a game session is ending. If the server process doesn't call <code>ProcessEnding()</code>, the game session termination won't conclude successfully.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>FORCE_TERMINATE</code> – Prompts the Amazon GameLift Servers service to stop the server process immediately. Amazon GameLift Servers takes action (depending on the type of fleet) to shut down the server process without the normal game session shutdown sequence. </p> <note> <p>This method is not available for game sessions that are running on Anywhere fleets unless the fleet is deployed with the Amazon GameLift Servers Agent. In this scenario, a force terminate request results in an invalid or bad request exception.</p> </note> </li> </ul>"""
